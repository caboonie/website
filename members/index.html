    <h1>Current Members</h1>
<h2>Jenny Chan (with an "E")</h2>
<p>Fly Eagles Fly! (She's from Philly) </p>
<h2>Anshula Gandhi</h2>
<p>Anshula's idea of a good time is watching pre-frat-bros walk barefoot on
catwalks covered in Legos. "The smaller the better," she earnestly affirms.
"That way there's more pressure per square inch."</p>
<h2>Andrea Garcia</h2>
<p>Andrea Garcia is a women of many talents and lives. By day she is a member of
the class of 2020 studying brain and cognitive sciences. By afternoon, she's a
valued member of the LCC, MIT's latinx cultural community. By evening she's one
of the coolest members of the MIT Cheerleading team. And by night, she's the
best dancer at SaveTFP you've ever seen.</p>
<h2>Remi Godinez</h2>
<p>Remi is the most fabulous human being you will ever meet. Be wary of her aura of
awesomeness. Some have been known to spontaneously combust upon contact.</p>
<h2>Jinny Lee (with a "J")</h2>
<p>Jinny and her pet unicorn Frances come from the coral studded plains of
Atlantis. When asked about her country of origin, she simply responed, "Well,
you can't go back home." Jinny is also a master at good ideas. Like spending
$200 on a Beyonce cutout. You should ask her for advice some time.</p>
<h2>Theresa Lo</h2>
<p>Theresa has a bad habit of getting into sushi competitions. Doesn't even like
sushi that much, just super competitive. Is a swimmer/swammer but hates water
because it makes her hair poofy. Tries to increase her spice tolerance by buying
bags of hot cheetos. If you have a cat she'll like you. If you send her cat
pictures or cat memes she'll like you. If she strokes you don't be alarmed it
just means your jacket looks nice. Tends to fangirl over how hot her friends
are. Accidentally says sexual things.</p>
<h2>Caleb Noble</h2>
<p>I am from Montana even though I pretend to be Canadian or German (the heart
wants what the heart wants). Currently I am a first year student pursuing a
degree in 6.2, even though I really enjoy participating in Design Build Fly. I
am a Mitglieder des Deutschen Hauses, and in my free time I love to bake
brioche, sing in church, and learning new languages. I joined SaveTFP because
they have the best friends and food (which are not mutually exclusive).</p>
<h2>Jason Priest</h2>
<p>Huge dog fan. Love woofers and fluffums and pooches of ever shape, breed, size,
and creed. However, for now, he must content himself to live without a pupper,
cuddling virtual doggos instead.</p>
<h2>Alex Roman</h2>
<p>Unhealthily obsessed with reality television. His biggest dream? To be a
contestant on Big Brother. He would probably choose to be on Big Brother over
attending Commencement. Let's just say he has...different priorities.</p>
<h2>Ginny Rosenberger (with a "G")</h2>
<p>Ginny enjoys singing (usually Disney and musical theater songs) and creative
writing (science fiction and fantasy are her favorites). She also loves animals
(cats!), coffee, laughing at really silly/bad jokes (often made by her), and
baking yummy things.</p>
<h2>Sara Sime</h2>
<p>Can be most often found parading around campus with a cutout of her best
pregnant homegirl, Beyonce. Her dream in life is to meet Bob Ross and hear his
sweet voice describing the scenery in all manner of bizarre paint colors (alas,
Sara is unaware that her dream is in fact, hopeless. But we won't spoil her
fun).</p>
<h2>Leilani Trautman</h2>
<p>Leilani plays the sousaphone, has a pet parrot named Paco, thinks space is cool,
and would describe herself as an extroverted introvert.</p>
